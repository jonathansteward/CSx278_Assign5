  2. How helpful do you think that having a text messaging application to solve this problem would be?
  3. How often do you need to check the due dates of assignments for the week?
  4. What other related problems do you believe that this application would need to solve?
  5. How often would you use this application?
  6. Would it be more helpful for the application to send you the URL of the bright space classroom page to log into or for you to send   the class that you wanted to see dates for and it sends you the dates in a text message with the assignment URLs?

  8. How soon would you want to see this application done?

# Answers:

## Question 1: 
  1. Because we don't have notifications sent to our emails automatically
  1. Because most teachers use it as a platform to post assignments so there’s no other option.
  1. I’m not sure why this is the only option. It forces students to have to either maintain their own schedules or constantly open Brightspace, both of which can be a bit time-consuming
  
## Question 2:
  2. I think a text messaging application would be extremely helpful in order to solve the problem. It would allow students to be easily reminded of assignments that are on the horizon, without having to manually check. Furthermore, students tend to use their phones frequently, so it would also be very practical.
  2. Pretty useful. I know a lot of people hate logging onto brightspace on their computers. However, I don’t mind it. 
  2. It would be easier than using the bright space website because even though it has a mobile site, most people carry around their phones. Having texts would be a good way to get updates since it's fast and easy to access.

## Question 3:
  3. I check for due dates about 3-5 times a week.
  3. Every day
  3. Frequently because only major assignments have the due dates up on bright space's main page for my course

## Question 4:
  4. I think it would be helpful if application could also provide the ability to notify when new grades have been posted or important class announcements.
  4.  Ideally every class’s interface would need to be the same. For example, some professors place assignments under “content” while others put it under “assignments” and it gets confusing. 
  4. There should be like a countdown saying how many days left until it's due 

## Question 5:
  5. I would use this application multiple times per week.
  5.  Maybe a few times a week. I like having a bigger screen to view assignments on as opposed to using my phone.
  5. I would use it a lot since I have a lot of work

## Question 6:
  6. I think it would be more helpful for the user to end the class he or she wants to see date for and then be returned the dates in a text message with assignment URLs.
  6. I like the latter option. 
  6. send the class option

## Question 7:
  7. I believe the email functionality for this application would work as Brightspace and VU Gmail has interconnectedness through YES.
  7.  Yes!
  7. Yes

## Question 8:
  8. I would like for this application to be created by next semester.
  8. I don’t have too much of an issue with brightspace as of now, so there’s no rush for me. Ideally before I graduate in May.
  8. By the end of the year

## Question 9:
  9. Office hour checking would be very helpful for this application, but I would not force the user to receive information about it if they do not want to.
  9.  Oh I definitely think that would be a bonus.
  9. Yes

## Question 10:
  10. Yes, it would be useful to be able to pull up multiple classes at once with due dates listed out via a URL as it would consolidate information and be very efficient.
  10. Absolutely. That way you could have a better idea of what your days are going to look like.
  10. That would be very convenient
